- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Al Shariar Dhruba. I am currently a student at LAB University of Applied Sciences studying Industrial Information Technology. I use GitHub to connect with people and to save my study progress.
I am from Bangladesh, Dhaka. I have completed my secondary and higher secondary from my country. I have a Bachelor degree in Phamrcy Professional from North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
I really like travelling, and collectiong coins from different countries. I have almost 15 coins from 15 different countries.
As I mentioned I have completed my undergraduate in Pharmacy, I have a wide variety of knowledge regarding asian medicine and drugs, I also have the basic idea about the drug law and regulations in Bangladesh.
I switched my studies from Pharmacy to Industrial IT because I wanted to explore the IT area and its oppurtunities.
